          <h3>Webaholic</h3>
          You hardly find me without my laapy until my face pressed against its screen. Otherwise one could expect me trapped inside pile of books.
          I strongly believe in knowledge rather than in experience and always eager to prove the same. I love playing around  new tech trendz and technologies and would like to
          document everything.
          <br><br>
          <h3>What I do</h3>
          I am a hardcore Java fan I never ever feel bore experimenting with Java technologies. In my leisure time I prefer spending time in solving coding challenges, learning cloud based
          technologies, doing pencil sketch and cultivating new ideas.
          <br><br>

          </ul>
          <br>
